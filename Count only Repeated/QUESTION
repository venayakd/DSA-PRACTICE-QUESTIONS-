Given an array arr[] of N positive integers, where elements are consecutive (sorted). Also, there is a single element which is repeating X (any variable) number of times.
Now, the task is to find the element which is repeated and number of times it is repeated.
Note: If there's no repeating element, Return {-1,-1}.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {1,2,3,3,4}
Output: 3 2
Explanation: In the given array, 3 is 
occuring two times.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {2,3,4,5,5}
Output: 5 2
Explanation: In the given array, 5 is 
occuring two times.
Example 3:

Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {1,2,3}
Output: -1 -1
Explanation: In the given array, there's no
repeating element, and thus the given Output
